#  RealWorldApp Automation with Cypress

##  About this project

This repository is an adaptation of the **RealWorldApp** project, created to practice and demonstrate test automation using **Cypress with JavaScript**.

It is part of my personal portfolio as a QA in training and was built with educational purposes in mind.

##  Upcoming automated tests

Soon, this repository will include examples of automated tests such as:

- Login tests
- User information editing
- Critical user flows
- Validation and error handling

Stay tuned for updates!
